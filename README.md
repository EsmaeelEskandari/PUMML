# PUMML
PileUp Mitigation with Machine Learning

A simple architecture that was used in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08600](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08600) to implement PUMML. The function `pileup_model` takes in a dictionary of hyperparameters and returns a compiled [Keras](https://keras.io/) model.
